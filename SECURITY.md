# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently only the latest minor version will get security updates, but that will
change once the project reaches version 1.0.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a potential vulnerability in the checks framework, please submit the
report to https://github.com/scott-wilson/openchecks/security/advisories/new.
Only the project maintainers will have access to these messages. Please include
detailed steps to reproduce the issue, preferably with code examples, and any
other information that could aid an investigation. Our policy is to respond
within 14 days, and address security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
